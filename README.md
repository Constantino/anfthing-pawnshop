#aNFThing Pawnshop

This project was created to allow people to get loans with NFTs as collateral. We know there are other solutions but this one has some features which can make it a complete platform to move your NFTs.

#Get ready to pawn
If you are in a difficult situation where you need some money but yoou don't want to loose your holdings you can use your NFTs as a collateral.This way you can ease the moment and be able to get your NFTs back later.

#Diversify your portfolio
In case you are looking to invest your money in a different way join as a crowdlender. You can lend money and earn interests, look for the NFTs that you like, choose a participation and wait for your money. Once the NFT is paid you get your money back.

#Cheaper than in marketplaces
Since this is a pawnshop we need the money back, in case the NFT is  not paid it will be on sale, probably cheaper than the actual market price. This can be a great feature since the people can come to buy those rare NFTs for their favorite videogames.

In this repo we included the contracts and tests. You can see the integration with the front-end in the page anfthing.io

We would love your feedback <3
